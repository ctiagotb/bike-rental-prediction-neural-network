# Project 1: Neural Network
## Predict daily bije rental ridership using neural network

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

To run this code I recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

The code is provided in the notebook `DLND Your first neural network.ipynb` notebook file. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory that contains this README and run **one** of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook DLND Your first neural network.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook DLND Your first neural network.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included in the folder Bike-Sharing-Dataset. Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv:
	
	- instant: record index
	- dteday : date
	- season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
	- yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)
	- mnth : month ( 1 to 12)
	- hr : hour (0 to 23)
	- holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)
	- weekday : day of the week
	- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
	+ weathersit : 
		- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
		- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
		- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
		- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
	- temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 41 (max)
	- atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 50 (max)
	- hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)
	- windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)
	- casual: count of casual users
	- registered: count of registered users
	- cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered
